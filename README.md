1. Apply industry standard agile techniques in develop software in a team. (APPLICATION, TEAM WORKING).
 
2. Use group and individual retrospectives to critically evaluate and propose improvements in developing software in a professional context. (PROBLEM SOLVING).

The purpose of the group task is give you practice developing a system using agile techniques, not the development of an extensive system. 

Goal – to produce a prototype system that demonstrates high priority functionality for the GreenLine Passenger Targeting System (PTS)

The detailed specification of the system will be developed in conjunction with the product owner (your tutor) using the Scrum methodology. 

Your group must keep a record, which should contain at minimum: 
•	Product backlog, to be entered during the first week and updated as necessary, including during Backlog Refinement Meetings.

For each sprint:   
•	the agreed goal and sprint backlog, to be entered in the Sprint Planning Meeting 
•	The list of backlog items "done", to be entered during the Sprint Review 
•	A list of things that went well, potential improvements and action plan to be entered at the end of the Sprint Retrospective
•	The date and time of each meeting (Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum meetings, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective) must be recorded, along with the list of who was present and any apologies received.

The final version of your portfolio should show how your project evolved over time.  You should describe what other tools (such as version control and task management) you have used, and either provide links to them or include screen shots showing examples of their use.
